# Module-13-Challenge

The notebook in the Starter_Code folder contains a neural network trianed to identify whether start-up will or will not fail. 


## Libraries

To run the notebook you will need to install Tensorflow and Scikt Learn.

## Conclusion

Even after multiple optimizations the accuracy of the model barely moved. To further optimize the model it might be useful to drop some of the features.
